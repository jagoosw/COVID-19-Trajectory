Two simple demos:

First, I sneezed, sang, talked & coughed toward an agar culture plate with or without a mask. Bacteria colonies show where droplets landed. A mask blocks virtually all of them.

@MarkAPD43Says the fella who will back track very soon. Recent daily hospital admission rate shows this number of people lost to Covid is already baked in. 4K a day not beyond possibilities without further action.
